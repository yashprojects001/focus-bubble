## 🌈 What is Focus Bubble?

🫧 **Focus Bubble** is a **minimal productivity website** that helps users enter a **deep-focus state** by removing all visual distractions.

Once a session begins, the screen darkens completely and only a **single floating timer bubble** remains — gently breathing to promote calm, sustained attention.

> 💡 *Focus Bubble believes:  
> “If something doesn’t help you focus — remove it.”*
